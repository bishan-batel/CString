# CString Example
Example CString Class that I refer to a lot in 
[my C++ notes](https://bishan.app/02+Personal/Me+Bitching+about+C%2B%2B). 

---

This repo contains how I would write a class that wraps around a normal C-Style String in a safe manner with all C++ conventions I would normally use.

All parts of this project are annotated with a link to a note on https://bishan.app that describes the relevant feature.
